Who are your users and why are they using the system?
-Students:
-Mentors: to help the students get further along in their project


What behaviors, assumptions, and expectations color their view of the system?

Condense the research: Look for themes/characteristics that are specific, relevant, and universal to the system and its users.

Brainstorm: Organize elements into persona groups that represent your target users. Name or classify each group.

Refine: Combine and prioritize the rough personas. Separate them into primary, secondary, and, if necessary, complementary categories. You should have roughly 3-5 personas and their identified characteristics.
Make them realistic: Develop the appropriate descriptions of each personas background, motivations, and expectations. Do not include a lot of personal information. Be relevant and serious; humor is not appropriate.
